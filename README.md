# Pokémon Emerald Gift

This is a fork of the [decompilation of Pokémon Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).  
Made as a 2022 Christmas gift for a friend, where the character sprites are made to look like him.  
To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Link to [Patch File is Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GFChFDEmOJHn6WBoZAN-GRA9a2UXGeu_?usp=sharing).  
To build it, use [LunarIPS](https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/) and your legally obtained copy of Pokémon Emerald (those devs who made the game 20 years ago gotta eat too).
